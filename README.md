CSS properties and its usage:

scroll-behavior: smooth; is the simplest way to enable native smooth-scrolling for in-page links (anything that uses href="#section-id" or element.scrollIntoView()).

It Tells the browser to animate vertical/horizontal scrolling instead of ‚Äújumping.‚Äù

Works on any scrollable element (the whole page, or any element with overflow: auto), but setting it on html is enough for most sites.

line-height: 1.6; Because you put it on the body, that value is inherited by every element (unless an element later overrides it). So all paragraphs, list items, headings, etc., start with a line height of 1.6 √ó their own font size.
Example: If a paragraph inherits font-size: 16px:
/* inherited from body */
line-height = 1.6 √ó 16 px = 25.6 px 
So the vertical space each line occupies is ‚âà 26 px, giving text room to breathe.

Why the ‚Äútight‚Äù paragraph looks bigger even though the font-size is identical

Because the tight paragraph squeezes its lines closer together, the eye perceives a denser ‚Äútext block.‚Äù Dense blocks feel bolder and can trick us into thinking the letters themselves are larger‚Äîeven though they‚Äôre not.

More white space around the same letters makes them appear smaller; packing them tightly makes them appear larger.

Purpose of z-index:
z-index controls stacking order‚Äîwhich overlapping, positioned elements (those with position: relative/absolute/fixed/sticky) appear on top of which.
